# YouTube Clarity
YouTube Clarity is a browser extension that removes flashy, distracting thumbnails from YouTube videos, and sets their titles to lowercase to feel less click-baity.

## Features
- Hide thumbnails from displaying on YouTube, while still allowing video previews to play when mouse hovers over the video.
- Set video titles to lowercase.
- Only run the extension during certain times of the day (user can select times through the extension popup).
